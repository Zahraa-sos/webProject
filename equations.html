        <h1>What Is An Equation?</h1>
        <p>An equation is a mathematical sentence that has two equal sides
            separated by an equal
            sign.(See the example below:) <br>
            x+1 = 4 <br>
            That equations says: <br>
        </p>
        <h4>what is on the left (x + 1) is equal to what is on the right (4)</h4>

        </div>

        <h2>Equation Parts:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Variable:</strong> A symbol for a number we don't know yet,
                often represented by letters
                like x or y.</li>
            <li><strong>Constant:</strong> A number on its own, without any variable,
                which does not change.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Coefficient:</strong> A number used to multiply a variable.
                For example, in the
                expression 4x, 4 is the coefficient.</li>
            <li><strong>Implicit Coefficient:</strong> When a variable is written
                without a number next to it,
                it's assumed to have a coefficient of 1. For instance, x is
                equivalent to 1x.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types Of Equations</h2>
        <p>Based on the degree, equations can be classified into three types.
            Following are the three types of
            equations in math:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Linear Equations: an equation in which the highest power of the
                variable is always.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Quadratic Equations: polynomial equations of degree 2 in one
                variable of type f(x) = ax2 + bx +
                c = 0 where a, b, c, ∈ R and a ≠ 0.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Cubic Equations: is an algebraic equation of degree three and
                is of the form ax3 + bx2 + cx + d
                = 0.</li>
        </ul>

        </div>

        <h2>How to Solve an Equation?</h2>

        <p> -move everything except "x" (or whatever name the variable has) over to the right hand side.
            <br>
            <br>
            Example: <br>
            Solve 3x−6 = 9
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Start with: (3x - 6 = 9)</li>
            <li>Add 6 to both sides: (3x = 9 + 6)</li>
            <li>Divide by 3: (x = (9 + 6)/3)</li>
            <li>The answer is:x = 5</li>
        </ol>

            <h2>What is a Solution?</h2>
            <p>A Solution is a value we can put in place of a variable (such as x) 
                that makes the equation true.
            </p>
            <h4>Example: </h4>
            <p>x − 2 = 4</p>

            <p>When we put 6 in place of x we get: <br>
                6 − 2 = 4<br>
                which is true. <br>
               <strong>So x = 6 is a solution.</strong> 
            </p>

            <h4>How about other values for x?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>For x=5 we get "5−2=4" which is not true, so x=5 is not a solution.</li>
                <li>For x=9 we get "9−2=4" which is not true, so x=9 is not a solution.</li>
                <p>In this case x = 6 is the only solution.</p>
            </ul>

            <h3>More Than One Solution</h3>
            <p>There can be more than one solution.</p>
            <h4>Example: (x−3) (x−2) = 0</h4>
            <p>When x is 3 we get: <br>
                (3−3) (3−2) = 0 × 1 = 0
                <br>
                <strong >which is true </strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                And when x is 2 we get:
                <br>
                (2−3) (2−2) = (−1) × 0 = 0
                <br>
                which is also true
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>So the solutions are:</strong>
                <br>
                x = 3, or x = 2
            </p>

            <p>When we gather all solutions together it is called a Solution Set <br>
                The above solution set is: {2, 3}
            </p>
