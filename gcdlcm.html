        <h2 class="fr3">What is a multiple?</h2>
        <p >We get a multiple of a number when we
            multiply it by another number. Such as multiplying by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc,
            but not zero. Just like the multiplication table.</p>
        <h3 class="fr2">Example:</h3>
        <p>
            Multiples of 4 = M4 = 0,4,8,12,16,20,24,28,32…. <br>
            What is common multiple? <br>
            When we list the multiples of (for example) 4 and 5,
            the common multiples are those that are found in both
            lists: <br>
            Multiples of 4 = M4 = 0,4,8,12,16,20,24,28,32…. <br>
            Multiples of 5 = M5 = 0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35… <br>
        </p>
        <h3 class="fr2">Notice that 20 and 40 appear in both lists?</h3>
        <p>So, the common multiples of 4 and 5 are:
            20, 40, (and 60, 80, etc ..., too) <br>
            Now, are you ready to know what is LCM?
            It is the smallest positive number that is a multiple of two or more numbers.
        </p>
        <h3 class="fr2">Let’s see an example: <br>
            Least Common Multiple of 3 and 5:
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Find the multiples of both numbers</li>
            <li>Find the first Common (same) value</li>
            <ul>
                <li>M3 = 0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24….</li>
                <li>M5 = 0,5,10,15,20,25,30….</li>
                <p>(15 is a multiple of both 3 and 5, and is the smallest number like that.)
                    So, LCM (3,5) = 15
                </p>
            </ul>
        </ol>

        <h1 class="fr1">GCD</h1>
        <h2 class="fr3">What is a factor?</h2>
        <p>Factors are numbers we can multiply together to get another number:</p>
        <img src="img/l-1.png">
        <p>A number can have many factors: <br>
            Factors of 20 = 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20 <br>
            because 2 × 10 = 20 and 4 × 5 = 20…
        </p>
        <h2 class="fr3">What is common factor?</h2>
        <p>Then the common factors are those that are found in both lists: <br>
            -Factors of 12 and 20: <br>
            Factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12 <br>
            Factors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15 and 30
        </p>
        <h3 class="fr2">Then the common factors are those that are found in both lists:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Notice that 1, 2, 3 and 6 appear in both lists?</li>
            <li>So, the common factors of 12 and 30 are: 1, 2, 3 and 6</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="fr2">Now, are you ready to know what is GCF?</h3>
        <p>It is simply the largest of the common factors. <br>
            In the example above, we noticed that the common factors of 12 and 30 are 1, 2 and 6,
            well the GCF is then 6 because it should be the GREATEST.
