    <h1> What is a Quadrilateral?</h1>
    <p>A quadrilateral is a polygon having four sides, four angles, and four vertices.<br>The word
        ‘quadrilateral’ is derived from the Latin words ‘quadri,’ which means four, and ‘latus’, which means side.</p>
    <h1>Properties of a Quadrilateral</h1>
    <img src="img/rulersp.png" class="rulersp">
    <ul>
        <li>four sides (edges)</li>
        <li>four vertices (corners)</li>
        <li>interior angles that add to 360 degrees</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Parallelogram</h2>
    <h4>Properties of a Parallelogram</h4>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Opposite sides are parallel</li>
        <li>Opposite sides are equal in length</li>
        <li>Opposite angles are equal</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Area of a Parallelogram</h4>
    <img src="img/think.png" class="think">
    <p>The Area is the base times the height:<br>
        Area = b × h</p>
    <p>Example: A parallelogram has a base of 6 m and is 3 m high, what is its Area?<br>
        Area = 6 m × 3 m = 18 m² </p>
    <h4>Perimeter of a Parallelogram</h4>
    <div class="parallelogram"></div>
    <p>The Perimeter is the distance around the edges.<br>The Perimeter is 2 times the (base +
        side length):<br>
        Perimeter = 2(b+s)</p>
        <img src="img/calculating.png" class="calculating">
    <p>Example: A parallelogram has a base of 12 cm and a side length of 6 cm, what is its
        Perimeter?<br>
        Perimeter = 2 × (12 cm + 6 cm) = 2 × 18 cm = 36 cm</p>
    <h4>Diagonals in a Parallelogram</h4>
    <p>The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.<br>
    In other words the diagonals intersect each other at the half-way point.</p>

    <h2>Rectangle</h2>
    <h4>Properties of a Rectangle</h4>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Each internal angle is 90°</li>
        <li>Opposite sides are parallel and of equal length</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="rectangle"></div>
    <h4>Area of a Rectangle</h4>
    <p>Area = L × w</p>
    <p>Example: A rectangle is 6 m wide and 3 m high, what is its Area?<br>Area = L × w <br>
        = 6 m × 3m<br>   
        = 18 m² </p>
    <h4>Perimeter of a Rectangle</h4>
    <p>The Perimeter is the distance around the edges.<br>The Perimeter is 2 times (a + b):
        <br> Perimeter = 2(L+w)
    </p>
   
    <p>Example: A rectangle is 12 cm long and 5 cm tall, what is its Perimeter?<br>
        Perimeter = 2 × (12 cm + 5 cm)<br>
        = 2 × 17 cm<br>
        = 34 cm</p>
        
    <h4>Diagonals in a Rectangle</h4>
    <p>A rectangle has two diagonals, they are equal in length and intersect in the middle.</p>


    <h2>Square</h2>
    <h4>Properties of a Square</h4>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>All sides are equal in length</li>
        <li>Each internal angle is 90°</li>
        <li>Opposite sides are parallel </li>
    </ol>
    <div class="square"></div>
    <h4>Area of a Square</h4>
    <p>There two methods to calculate teh area of the square: </p>
    <p>The Area is the side length squared:<br>
        Area = a² = a × a</p>
    <p>The Area is also half of the diagonal squared:<br></p>
        Area &nbsp;=&nbsp;<div class="fr">  
            <span class="n">d²</span>
            <span class="d">2</span>
        </div>
    <p>Example: A square has a side length of 6 m, what is its Area?<br>
        Area = 6 m × 6 m = 36 m²</p>

    <h4>Perimeter of a Square</h4>
    <p>The Perimeter is the distance around the edges.<br> The Perimeter is 4 times the side length: <br>
        Perimeter = 4a</p>
    <p>Example: A square has a side length of 12 cm, what is its Perimeter?<br>
        Perimeter = 4 × 12 cm = 48 cm</p>
    <h4>Diagonals of a Square</h4>
    <p>A square has two diagonals, they are equal in length and intersect in the middle.<br>The Diagonal is the side length times the square root of 2:
        <br> Diagonal "d" = a × √2</p>
 



     <h2>Rhombus</h2>
     <h4>Properties of a Rhombus</h4>
     <ol type="a">
         <li>All sides have equal length</li>
         <li>Opposite sides are parallel, and opposite angles are equal (it is a Parallelogram)</li>
         <li>The altitude is the right angle distance between opposite sides</li>
     </ol>
     <div class="diamond"></div>
     <h4>Area of a Rhombus</h4>
     <p>The Area can be calculated by multiplying the lengths of the diagonals and then dividing by 2:<br></p>
     Area &nbsp;=&nbsp;<div class="fr">  
         <span class="n">a×b</span>
         <span class="d">2</span>
     </div>
   
     <h4>Perimeter of a Rhombus</h4>
     <p>The Perimeter is the distance around the edges<br>The Perimeter is 4 times "s" (the side length) because all sides are equal in length:<br>
         Perimeter = 4s</p>
     <p>Example: A rhombus has a side length of 12 cm, what is its Perimeter?<br>
         Perimeter = 4 × 12 cm = 48 cm</p>
        
 
     <h2>Trapezoid</h2>
     <h4>Properties of a Trapezoid</h4>
     <ol type="a">
         <li>has a pair of parallel sides</li>
         <li>is an isosceles trapezoid when it has equal angles from a parallel side</li>
     </ol>
     <div class="trapezoid"></div>
     <h4>Area of a Trapezoid</h4>
     <p>The Area is the average of the two base lengths times the altitude: <br></p>
         Area &nbsp;=&nbsp;<div class="fr">  
         <span class="n">a+b</span>
         <span class="d">2</span>
     </div>×h
     <p>Example: A trapezoid's two bases are 6 m and 4m, and it is 3m high. What is its Area?</p>
     Area &nbsp;=&nbsp;<div class="fr">  
         <span class="n">6 m × 4 m</span>
         <span class="d">2</span>
     </div>× 3 m = 5 m × 3 m  =  15 m²
     <h4>Perimeter of a Trapezoid</h4>
     <p>The Perimeter is the distance around the edges.<br> 	
         The Perimeter is the sum of all side lengths:<br>
         Perimeter = a+b+c+d <br>
         Perimeter = 4a</p>
     <p>Example: A trapezoid has side lengths of 5 cm, 12 cm, 4 cm and 15 cm, what is its Perimeter?<br>
         Perimeter = 5 cm + 12 cm + 4 cm + 15 cm  = 36 cm</p>
